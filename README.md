# Edinburgh Napier University Honours Project

This honours project looks to compare the performance of a distributed agent network written in Elixir to one written using the common agent framework JADE.

## Project Structure

- [dissertation/](./dissertation/) This contains the LaTeX files for my dissertation.
- [management/](./management/) This stores any files that I need to append to my dissertation and general planning files. These are mostly all stored using Git LFS.
- [src/](./src/) This contains all the source code for the agent systems.
  - [supply_chain_elixir/](./src/supply_chain_elixir/) This contains the Elixir project.
  - `supply_chain_jade/` This will contain the JADE project.
