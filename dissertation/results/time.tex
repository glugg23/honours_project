\subsection{Time}\label{sec:time}

The third benchmark was the mean total time for all of the 220 rounds to finish for each of the experiments.
This measurement shows how quickly the system can make decisions and execute other steps such as sending messages.

\Cref{fig:mean_time_diff} shows the average time that was required for all the experiments to finish.
The error bars show the standard deviation from the mean value.
It is immediately apparent that the JADE system is significantly slower than the Elixir system.
All of the experiments run in under 1 second for the Elixir system with most running under half a second.
The simplest experiment took on average 3 seconds for the JADE system and the most complex experiment took over 12 seconds on average to complete.

Not plotted is the average time between each round.
As each experiment uses the same number of rounds, the average time per round can be found by dividing the total time by 220.

\Cref{fig:time_per_round} shows the time taken between each round for a specific run of experiment 5.
In this chart, we can see from the trendline that the Elixir system has a fairly consistent time per round.
Interestingly, we can see that the JADE system starts slow but speeds up towards the middle of the experiment, before slowing down a bit again near the end.
This is likely caused by Java's JIT compiler which is still optimising the program for the first rounds of the experiment.

From these results, we can easily see that Elixir is faster than a system implemented in JADE\@.
This is an unexpected result as it was expected that the maturity of the Java platform would give JADE an advantage in terms of execution time.
Further investigation would be required to work out what is causing the JADE system to perform so slowly.
Whether it is caused by a potential bad design in the multi-agent system or whether the JADE framework code is unoptimised.
