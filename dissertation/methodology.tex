\section{Methodology}

For this project, two important aspects need to be planned out.
The first is the design of the multi-agent system that will be benchmarked and how this system will be implemented in both Elixir and JADE\@.
The second is how this system will be benchmarked to determine which of the two implementations perform better.

This section will first detail the language-agnostic design of the multi-agent system.
Then it will describe how this has been implemented in both Java and Elixir, making note of any dependencies used as well as any particular advantages and disadvantages that were discovered for both languages.

Then this section will describe the various aspects of this system that will be benchmarked, and how this will be achieved.

\subsection{Benchmarking}

The issue with using Docker is that it makes benchmarking more difficult.
Running the entire system virtualised on one machine is not representative of a real-world deployment.

An alternative approach would be to run all the containers in a cloud provider such as Azure.
From some quick experimentation, there does not seem to be a way to measure the resource usage of a single container in Azure, just the whole container group.

Running the system on individual machines is also an option, either rented in the cloud or physical machines such as Raspberry Pis, but this would likely result in a lot of time required to set these machines up.
