\section{Methodology}

Introduction to the chapter.

Write about what will be covered.

\subsection{System Design}

Write what the system does each round of the simulation.

Write about each type of agent.

Add message sequence diagram for a typical round of the simulation.

\subsection{Agent Design}

Describe each of the layers of the agent and what they do.

Add message sequence diagram for communication between layers.

\subsection{JADE}

Introduction to JADE system.

Using Java 8 as this is the last long term support version where JADE can be compiled, although due to the nature of Java bytecode a later version could be used.

Each layer is a separate agent instance.

At start-up the specific layers are started depending on the system environment.

\subsubsection{Information Layer}

Passes messages to Knowledge layer.

Is implemented in a similar style to a GenServer, this is done by extending the Cyclic Behaviour from JADE and implementing that in the class.

\subsubsection{Knowledge Layer}

Acts as the knowledge base in the system.

There is an abstract Knowledge agent which the others extend.
This agent defines common behaviour like the Elixir macros.

This class loads config values from a properties file.

Write about attempt to form agent federation and why this did not work.

Write about de-serialising agent information from XML file and why JADE custom collections made serialising JADE objects more difficult.

\subsubsection{Behaviour Layer}

Implemented using JADE's finite state machine behaviour.

Explain the behaviour of the different agent types.

\subsection{Docker}

Explain the use of Docker during development.

Explain how Docker could be used for benchmarking.
