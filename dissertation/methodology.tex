\section{Methodology}

This section covers the design of the system as well as how it will be benchmarked.

\subsection{Benchmarking}

The issue with using Docker is that it makes benchmarking more difficult.
Running the entire system virtualised on one machine is not representative of a real-world deployment.

An alternative approach would be to run all the containers in a cloud provider such as Azure.
From some quick experimentation, there does not seem to be a way to measure the resource usage of a single container in Azure, just the whole container group.

Running the system on individual machines is also an option, either rented in the cloud or physical machines such as Raspberry Pis, but this would likely result in a lot of time required to set these machines up.
