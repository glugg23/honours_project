\section{Methodology}

This section looks at how the Elixir and JADE systems have been designed.
First, the design of the whole multi-agent system, as well as the design of an individual agent are discussed.
Then the implementation of the Elixir and JADE systems are covered.
Finally, the metrics that have been benchmarked and the experiments that were devised are covered.
