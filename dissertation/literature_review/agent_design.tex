\subsection{Agent-based Design}

\citeA{vytelingum2005framework} propose a new framework for designing trading agents.
This framework is called the Information Knowledge Behavior (IKB) framework.
This framework splits the agent into three distinct layers which can only communicate with the layers next to it.

The Information layer handles gathering all the public information that is available in the environment and then adding the private information from the agent to it.
This layer filters out any unnecessary information but is still usually a noisy view of all the information that can be gathered.
The Knowledge layer then infers knowledge from the Information layer, converting it into a form that can be used by the Behavior layer.
The Behavior layer then take the knowledge from the Knowledge layer and uses it to decide the best course of action.

\citeA{vytelingum2005framework} believe that this framework is important as it provides a structured approach to designing agents, one which they found lacking from existing design strategies.

The IKB framework has been used by \citeA{podobnik2006crocodileagent} to develop a fairly successful trading agent for the TAC SCM competition.

\subsubsection{Communication}

KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) is an agent communication language developed by the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort.
KQML was created as a common standard for sending messages between multiple agents.
It uses an extendable set of performatives to indicate which type of message is being sent, and then the content of the message follows in various fields.
The syntax of the message is based on a balanced parenthesis list similar to the syntax of Common Lisp and can be transmitted as plain text or in a binary form.~\cite{finin1994kqml}

KQML has been criticised by \citeA{cohen1995communicative} for not having a precisely defined set of semantics.
This means when an agent sends a message with a certain performative, there is a no way of knowing if the other agent has implemented the same meaning of that performative.
Another issue they mention is that there is no way in KQML to ask an agent to complete a task in the future.

The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents Agent Communication Language (FIPA ACL) supersedes KQML and provides a more formally defined communication language which addresses some of the shortcomings of KQML\@.
FIPA defines multiple specifications for agent management/interaction/communication/etc.
However, this section will only focus on the specification for communication.

FIPA ACL specifies that messages are composed of five levels.
The protocol for dialog, the type of communication, any message metadata, how the content of the message is defined, and the ontology of the content expression.
FIPA ACL uses a smaller number of performatives than KQML but gives each of these a formal definition which must be followed for all systems that are FIPA compliant.
FIPA ACL uses the same S-expression syntax as KQML does, but provides an additional optional semantic language for the `content' field of the message.~\cite{obrien1998fipa}

JADE uses FIPA ACL messaging for the messages that get sent.
Elixir uses Erlang messages which can be any type defined by the language.
A typical message would be a tuple of an atom and a map of values.
While a full implementation of the FIPA protocol would be outside the scope of this project, ideas can still be drawn from the FIPA ACL messaging format.
The atom part of the typical message tuple could be used as a performative definition while the map contains the content of the message.
