\section{Results}

This section contains the results and analysis of the 5 experiments that were described in the previous section.
The aim of this section is to answer the research questions that were proposed in the introduction of this dissertation.
The results from running the 5 experiments will be used to determine whether the multi-agent system implemented in Elixir performs better than an identical system written used JADE\@.
The source code for both systems will then be compared to see whether the Elixir system is short and potentially easier to maintain that the JADE version.

The hardware that these benchmarks were run on was an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor, running at a base clock speed of 3.6 Ghz and 16 logical processors.
The hardware had 32 GB of DDR4 memory, running at 3533 Mhz.
As the experiments were run under Docker, the results may differ if the experiments were to be run directly on equivalent hardware.
Docker was configured to use all the available CPU cores and to use a maximum of 25 GB of memory.

The host machine for these experiments was running Windows 10 version 21H1 build 19043.1348.
The version of Docker used to run these experiments was Docker Desktop 4.1.1.
The Elixir system was built using the Elixir version 1.12.3 Docker image.
The JADE system was built using the Maven version 3.8.3 OpenJDK 8 image.
Both of these images use Ubuntu as the base operating system.

Each experiment was run 10 times to ensure results were reproducible.
Before each experiment was run, a warmup run was conducted.
This was to ensure that the Docker image was built and that any containers that were required had been instantiated.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Sum up all the results and determine which system is better.
