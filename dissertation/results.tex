\section{Results}

Look at the performance of both systems with different configurations.
For example 1 customer and 2 raw producers.
Then add new customer agents and new producer agents to see how the trading agent handles it.
The final benchmark would be a setup like that for TAC SCM, which would be 1 customer and 2 agents each for 4 unique components.
