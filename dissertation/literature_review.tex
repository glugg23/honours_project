\section{Literature Review}

As this project is attempting to write a multi-agent system in a language where this has not been done before, it is important to study what has been done with other technologies in this field.

Firstly, this section looks at the topic area that the multi-agent system will be written for: supply chains.
A brief overview of Just-in-Time manufacturing will be given in order to contextualise what the most common approach to real life supply chains is.
Then an overview of the existing multi-agent systems and models that exist for supply chains will be given.

Secondly, methods for designing multi-agent systems will be explored and those relevant to the design of this project will be highlighted.
As sending messages is important in multi-agent systems, some of the specifications for doing so will be discussed.

Finally, an overview of the programming languages and frameworks available for implementing multi-agent systems will be given, and a comparison of them will be done to show why Elixir seems to be a good choice for this project.
