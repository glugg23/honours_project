\section{Literature Review}

This project aims to model the impact of several economic factors on the performance of a factory using a multi-agent system.
Before this system can be implemented, it is important to review the existing literature to ensure the economic factors investigated are relevant and to evaluate the existing trading agent research.

Firstly, this section looks at the definition of Just-in-Time manufacturing and its relation to the research questions of this project.
Then existing trading agent models will be evaluated to see how suitable they would be for investigating the research questions.

Secondly, methods for designing multi-agent systems will be explored and those relevant to the design of this project will be highlighted.

Finally, an overview of the programming languages and frameworks available for implementing multi-agent systems, and a comparison of them to decide which one will be used for this project.
