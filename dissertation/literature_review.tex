The Erlang language was introduced by \citeA{armstrong1990erlang} as an experimental new programming language to be used for programming telephony systems.
Erlang is designed around using concurrent processes with no shared memory, which communicate using asynchronous message passing.
All of this is built into the language definition.~\cite{armstrong2007history}
The fact that this behaviour is implemented on a language basis and not as a third-party library is beneficial as it allows us to implement the basic Actor principle of message passing entirely using Erlang processes.
