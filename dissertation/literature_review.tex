\section{Literature Review}

As this project is attempting to write a multi-agent system in a language where this has not been done before, it is important to study what has been done with other technologies in this field.

Firstly, this section looks at the topic area that the multi-agent system will be written for: supply chains.
A brief overview of Just-in-Time manufacturing will be given to contextualise what the most common approach to real-life supply chains is.
Then an overview of the existing multi-agent systems and models that exist for supply chains will be given.

Secondly, methods for designing multi-agent systems will be explored and those relevant to the design of this project will be highlighted.
As sending messages is important in multi-agent systems, some of the specifications for doing so will be discussed.

Finally, an overview of the programming languages and frameworks available for implementing multi-agent systems will be given, and a comparison of them will be done to show why Elixir seems to be a good choice for this project.

\subsection{Summary}

In summary, this section looks at the types of multi-agent systems that have already been written for supply chains, ways in which agents can be designed and how they communicate with each other, and what technologies exist that can be used to implement agents.

This project will be implementing a multi-agent system based on the system used in the TAC SCM competition.
It is important for a benchmark to be based on an area of research that has already had interest shown in it to ensure the results are representative of research interests.
The topic of PC manufacturing was chosen because it requires the manufacturing agent to negotiate with multiple other types of agents.

The agents in this project will be designed to use the Information Knowledge Behavior framework.
This was chosen over a more traditional Blackboard System because of the complexity of implementing two Blackboard Systems from scratch without there being many benefits to doing so.

Elixir was chosen as the primary language for this implementation due to not having been used yet for writing a multi-agent system while being designed in a way that should make this easy.
JADE was chosen as the comparison implementation as it is currently the most popular technology to use for implementing agent-based systems.
