\subsection{Elixir}

Introduction to Elixir system.

Explain GenServer and how it is applies to agents.

Explain GenServer client/server API model.

Required implementing own message format.

Agent type loaded in via system environment.

Config loaded in via Elixir script file.

\subsubsection{Information Layer}

Handles inter-node connections by listening for nodeup events.

Library ``libcluster'' is used to automatically connect to other agents on the same network.

Builds the information filter for the agent.

Stores the node information in ETS, explain what ETS is.

Forwards any messages that pass through the information filter to the Knowledge layer.

\subsubsection{Knowledge Layer}

Loads config values into knowledge base.
Knowledge base is also stored in ETS\@.

Is responsible for updating Knowledge base as messages are received.

Each agent uses a separate Knowledge layer implementation.
Common functionality is included via the use of macros.

\subsubsection{Behaviour Layer}

The proactive and reactive behaviour of the agent.

Is implemented as a finite state machine using the library ``GenStateMachine'' which is a wrapper class for the Erlang module \verb|gen_statem|.

Explain the behaviour of the different agent types.
