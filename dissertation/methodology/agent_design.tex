\subsection{Agent Design}

The agents in this system have been designed after the Information Knowledge Behaviour (IKB) framework.
This means that the agents have been split into 3 distinct sub-systems.
The systems developed for these experiments take this idea further by isolating each layer into a separate process or agent.

The Information layer is responsible for receiving all the messages from other remote agents.
It uses an information filter to decide which messages need to be passed onto the Knowledge layer.
For example, a Manufacturer agent is interested in all the messages that are being sent and so has an empty information filter.
On the contrary, Producer agents have a knowledge filter of the Consumer agent as well as other Producer agents, as this type of agent is not interested in messages these agents send.

The Knowledge layer stores the information that it receives in a format that can be used by the Behaviour layer.
For this system, the Knowledge layer takes messages it receives and places them in an inbox.
The messages that are in the inbox can then be handled in batch by the Behaviour layer.

The Behaviour layer acts on the information that it receives from the Knowledge layer and decides what the agent shall do.
In a Consumer agent, this would be to check whether orders have been correctly delivered and to order new PCs.
In a Manufacturer agent, this would be to accept new PC orders and order the components required to build them.
In a Producer agent, this would be to accept component requests and to produce the correct amount of them.

\Cref{fig:agent_sequence_diagram} shows an example sequence diagram for the messages that are sent between the agent layers.
The dotted messages are messages that are only sent in the JADE system.
The Information layer forwards any messages that pass through the information filter to the Knowledge layer.
We can see that the Behaviour layer does not have access to the Information layer.
It can only communicate with the Knowledge layer and the Information layer can also only communicate with the Knowledge layer.
The Behaviour layer is responsible for sending messages to other agents but the messages are configured so that any replies are sent to the Information layer.
Therefore, it can be considered that the Information layer is the only part of the agent that is accessible to the rest of the multi-agent system.
