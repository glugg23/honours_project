\subsection{Deliverables}

There will be two deliverables for this project.
The first will be the developed agent-based model, designed to answer the research questions below.
The second will be the analysis of the experimental data that was gathered using this model.

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{sec:research_questions}

This project seeks build a model that can answer the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To what extent should demand history be used for calculating the amount of goods needing to be produced.
    \item Under which circumstances is it better to stockpile raw goods and finished products.
\end{enumerate}

The first question aims to see whether economic conditions exist such that the product demand history cannot be used to accurately calculate the number of goods that would need to be produced.
The second question tries to see whether a system of predictive stockpiling can be used to mitigate the conditions found by the first question.

\subsection{Project Overview}

This project will have several milestones that need to be completed.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
    \item [Literature Review] Background research on existing multi-agent models of supply chains and the technology that they use will need to be completed to provide a foundation for the implementation of this project.
    \item [Model Design] The multi-agent model will need to be designed in order to take full advantage of the technology chosen to implement this project it.
    \item [Model Implementation] After the model has been designed it will need to be implemented in a way that allows different simulation scenarios to be easily configured.
    \item [Data Gathering] Data will be gathered using the model in order to answer the research questions posed above.
    \item [Analysis] This data will be analysed in order to see to what extent it answers this project's research questions.
