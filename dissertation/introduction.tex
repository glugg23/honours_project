\section{Introduction}

Multi-agent systems.

What is Elixir.

Why Elixir could be used for multi-agent systems.

Project aims: implement system in Elixir, implement same system in JADE, compare.

Why this research is important: Elixir has not been used for this before.

\subsection{Deliverables}

There will be two deliverables for this project.
The first will be the complete multi-agent model written in Elixir.
The second will be a comparison model written in JADE\@.

\subsection{Research Questions}

This project seeks to answer the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compared to JADE, to what extent is it easier to write a multi-agent system in Elixir.
    \item Does a system written in Elixir perform better than a system written in JADE\@.
\end{enumerate}

The first question aims to see whether a system implemented in Elixir is more succinctly written than an equivalent system implemented using JADE\@.
The second question tries to see whether a system written in Elixir performs better in terms of CPU and memory usage than a system written with JADE\@.

\subsection{Project Overview}

This project will have several milestones that need to be completed.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
    \item [Literature Review] Background research on existing multi-agent systems primarily looking at supply chains and the technology that they use will need to be done to provide a foundation for the implementation of this project.
    \item [System Design] The multi-agent system will need to be designed so that it can be implemented in both Elixir and JADE, and distributed across multiple machines\@.
    \item [Implementation] After the system has been designed it will need to be implemented in both Elixir and JADE\@.
    \item [Analysis] Once the systems have been fully implemented they can be benchmarked and compared to see if Elixir produces a better multi-agent system.
